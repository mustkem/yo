# Yo - A Twitter Clone

Backend API for Yo using Nest framework (NodeJS + TypeScript + MySQL)

## About

Yo is a Twitter Clone.

## 🖼️ Avatar Upload to AWS S3 (Presigned URL)

### Methodology

1. **Generate Presigned URL**  
   Backend provides a presigned S3 URL and object key for secure direct image upload.

2. **Upload Image**  
   Frontend uses the URL to upload the image directly to S3 via a PUT request.

3. **Save Image Key**  
   The S3 object key is saved in the database as the user's avatar reference.

4. **Access Avatar**  
   The avatar can later be accessed using a signed URL generated by the backend.

### To-Do

- [x] Implement presigned upload flow
- [x] Store avatar key in user table
- [x] Fix CORS and bucket policy issues
- [ ] Add validation for file type and size

## 🔁 Kafka Integration

### Methodology

1. **Kafka Config Setup**  
   Kafka broker and client settings are loaded via `ConfigService` and made globally available. Broker connects to multiple topics dynamically.

2. **Kafka Producer/Consumer Modules**  
   Services use Kafka client to emit and consume events (e.g., user created).

3. **Microservice Communication**  
   Kafka enables decoupled communication between services for handling async operations.

### To-Do

- [x] Add Kafka config module using `@nestjs/config`
- [x] Setup Kafka producer and consumer service
- [x] Emit and listen to example events (e.g., user.created)
- [ ] Add retry logic and dead-letter queue (DLQ) support
- [ ] Document event schemas and versioning

# TODOs

## 🔐 TODO: Migrate to JWT-Based Hybrid Authentication Model

This plan outlines the steps to transition from the current auth system to a scalable JWT-based model that supports both access and refresh tokens.

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Setup JWT Infrastructure

- [ ] Install necessary packages (`@nestjs/jwt`, `passport-jwt`, etc.)
- [ ] Configure `JwtModule` in the Auth module
- [ ] Define JWT secret, expiration, and refresh settings in `.env`
- [ ] Create utility methods for `signAccessToken` and `signRefreshToken`
- [ ] Add centralized `TokenService` to manage token lifecycle

---

### 🧠 Phase 2: Hybrid Login Flow

- [ ] Update login endpoint to return:
  - Access Token (short-lived, e.g., 15 mins)
  - Refresh Token (long-lived, e.g., 7 days)
- [ ] Save refresh token in HttpOnly cookie or secure storage
- [ ] Add logic to hash and store refresh token in DB (optional for security)

---

### 🔄 Phase 3: Token Refresh Mechanism

- [ ] Create `/auth/refresh` endpoint
- [ ] Validate refresh token (DB or verify)
- [ ] Issue new access token (and optionally new refresh token)
- [ ] Add logic to rotate or blacklist old refresh tokens (optional)

---

### 🛡️ Phase 4: Secure Routes

- [ ] Implement `JwtAuthGuard` using `PassportStrategy`
- [ ] Protect authenticated routes with `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)`
- [ ] Create decorator to extract user info from JWT (`@CurrentUser()`)

---

### 🧹 Phase 5: Logout & Cleanup

- [ ] Create logout endpoint to:
  - Invalidate refresh token in DB
  - Clear cookie/session
- [ ] Optional: Add token revocation list (blacklist)

---

### 🧪 Final Tasks

- [ ] Write unit tests for token generation and guards
- [ ] Add E2E tests for login, refresh, and access
- [ ] Update frontend to handle:
  - Storing and refreshing tokens
  - Auto-logout on token expiry
- [ ] Document auth flow in README
